Ex 1: This one was pretty simple, the only thing I had to do, was to use 
functions to define the cartesian distance equation.

-- functions used: define, sqr, sqrt.

Ex 2: What I did here was simple and quick aswell, defined the strings 
that I had to use, incluiding the underscore ("_") and then just put it 
altogether with the string-append function.

-- functions used: define, string-append 

Ex 3: Here, I had to extract a letter from the string and the use 
functions to manipulate the result and make one whole string minus the 
letter removed. 

-- functions use:  define, string-append, substring.

## NOTE: From now on, I won't mention that I used define, because, well. 
I pretty much use it everywhere, and I believe it's one of the most used 
functions if not the most, within this language. ##
