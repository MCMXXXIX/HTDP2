Ex 1: This one was pretty simple, the only thing I had to do, was to use 
functions to define the cartesian distance equation.

-- functions used: define, sqr, sqrt.

Ex 2: What I did here was simple and quick aswell, defined the strings 
that I had to use, incluiding the underscore ("_") and then just put it 
altogether with the string-append function.

-- functions used: define, string-append 

Ex 3: Here, I had to extract a letter from the string and the use 
functions to manipulate the result and make one whole string minus the 
letter removed. 

-- functions use:  define, string-append, substring.

## NOTE: From now on, I won't mention that I used define, because, well. 
That function is pretty much used everywhere within this language. ##

Ex 6: Well after almost two weeks idling and dealing with happenstances of life I started again with my work regarding
this book.

This excercise was a pain in the ass, because it was so simple that I thought I had to do something more elaborated
Perhaps next time I'll try to copy a random car's model and attempt to do it with racket's primitives, I'm looking at you,
hachiroku. But until then I guess that white and red box with two pathetic wheels are going to be enough.
