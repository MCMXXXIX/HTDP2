"How to Design Programs 2" exercises.

I created this github account for fun, and to keep track of whatever I 
was doing regarding the book previously mentioned.

In "About Exercises" I'll just talk about what I was doing, and what I 
did to resolve # exercise.

The images folder is pretty self-explanatory, it contains the images 
used through the book.
